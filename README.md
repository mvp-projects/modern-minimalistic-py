## Inspiration
Nor Pydantic, FastAPI, Ruff, etc... seem to use `Poetry`. So I build a sample project (That might be worth to move as a `cookiecutter` template) that mimics the deps management those repositories use
- https://peps.python.org/pep-0665/
- https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/contributing/ -> We could not use requirements folder. But something like `FastAPI`
